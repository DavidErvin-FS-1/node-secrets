# Hard coded secrets

In this approach, sensitive information is directly embedded within the application's source code.

## Implications:

- Security Risks: Embedding secrets directly in the codebase can lead to unauthorized access if the code is shared or exposed.

- Maintenance Challenges: Updating secrets requires code modifications and redeployments, increasing the risk of errors.
