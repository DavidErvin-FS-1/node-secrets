# Node Secrets

This repository contains a collection simple applications that demonstrates how to use secrets in Node.js applications.

- **Hardcoded secrets**: A simple application that uses hardcoded secrets.
- **Shared secrets**: A simple application that uses shared secrets.
- **Environment variables**: A simple application that uses environment variables to store secrets.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher

## Getting Started

Each application is in its own directory. To run an application, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd <directory> # e.g., cd hardcoded-secrets
```

Then, install the dependencies:

````

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
````

Finally, run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Best Practices for Secrets Management

Transitioning from hard-coded or shared secrets to environment variables is a step toward better security. However, for robust secrets management, consider implementing the following practices:

Centralized Secrets Control Plane: Utilize a dedicated secrets management tool to store and access secrets centrally, reducing errors and simplifying security management.

Access Control Lists (ACLs): Define and enforce who can access specific secrets, ensuring that only authorized entities have access.

Dynamic Secrets: Generate secrets dynamically for short-lived use, minimizing the risk associated with long-term static secrets.

Encryption as a Service: Employ encryption services to protect data at rest and in transit, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without proper authorization.

Auditing: Regularly monitor and audit access to secrets to detect and respond to unauthorized access promptly.

By adopting these practices, you can enhance the security of your applications and protect sensitive information from potential threats.
